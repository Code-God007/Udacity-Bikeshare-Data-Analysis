US-Bikeshare-Data-Analysis

In this project we need to analyse Bikeshare data given in the format of csv files
from Chicago, New York City, Washington. It also takes in users' raw input to create an 
interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


Questions explored
The script answers the following questions about the bike share data:

What is the most popular month for start time?
What is the most popular day of week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for start time?
What is the most popular hour of day for start time?
What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
What is the most popular start station and most popular end station?
What is the most popular trip?
What are the counts of each user type?
What are the counts of gender?
What are the earliest (i.e. oldest person), most recent (i.e. youngest person), and most popular birth years?
